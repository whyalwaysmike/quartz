**Personal Objectives**
Players will get random easier tasks -- maybe ones that might cause suspicion that they are a traitor when they are not. Rewards for tasks is personal points or persistent leader-board, etc. Maybe levels?  
  
Ideas  
- Get X item - through whatever means available  
- Get X item from X player  
- how would they do this. Could also confirm that player has X item and maybe catch them in a lie  
- Discover another players personal task - could deincentivize meta gaming / cheating  
- not sure how to program this?
